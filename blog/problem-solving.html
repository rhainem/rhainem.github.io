              There was a problem where I had to join two arrays of strings
              together. At first, I wasn’t sure how to use .concat() properly
              because the example in the instructions looked different. I tried
              it a few different ways and console logged the result to see what
              was happening. After testing a couple of times, I got it working.
              It felt good because it was the first time I used .concat() by
              myself. I learned that reading documentation and testing small
              bits of code is a good way to figure out new methods.

                There was a challenge where I had to remove all the words "buzz"
                from a sentence, no matter how it was written. It didn’t work
                first go, but I remembered some previous exercises that used
                .split(), .filter(), and .join(), so I tried a similar approach.
                After a couple of tweaks, it worked. I felt relieved when it
                finally came together. I learned that practising similar
                problems really helps, and it’s easier to solve things when you
                can build off what you’ve already done.

                I was reluctant to ask for help on the kata challenge because I
                felt like I should figure it out on my own. But I fell behind
                and eventually had to ask. Once I got some guidance, I realised
                how important it is to ask early so I can properly understand
                and move forward.</p>
                <p>Next time, I’ll ask sooner because it
                saves time and helps things click faster.</p>
