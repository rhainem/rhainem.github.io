            You’ve probably heard the term the DOM, but maybe it just makes you
            think of The Don from The Godfather. In a way, they’re alike because
            both are in charge. The DOM controls everything you see on a
            webpage, and JavaScript uses it to make changes, just like The Don
            calls the shots in his family's territory.

          <h2>
            An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
            CSS.
          </h2>
          <p>
            If HTML is the Builder, and CSS is the Artist, then JavaScript is
            the Wizard who makes the magic happen.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What is <span class="code">control flow</span> and what are
            <span class="code">loops</span>?
          </h2>
          <p>
            In JavaScript <span class="code">control flow</span> refers to the
            order in which your computer runs code, which is usually from top to
            bottom. <span class="code">loops</span> are special statements that
            can change the control flow by repeating a block of code multiple
            times. A loop will keep running until there is either nothing left
            to loop over, or until a condition is no longer true.
          </p>
          <p>
            To picture it in real life, imagine grabbing apples from a basket at
            the grocery store. You keep taking apples until either the basket is
            empty or you’ve got as many as you need. In programming, a loop
            works the same way by repeating a task while a condition is true.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it.
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way for JavaScript to see and
            change what’s on a webpage. It turns the webpage into a structure
            that JavaScript can work with. For example, you can use JavaScript
            to find a button on a page and change what it says when you click
            it.
          </p>

          <h2>What are<span class="code">functions?</span></h2>
          <p>
            <span class="code">functions</span> are reusable blocks of code that
            perform specific tasks. You can call a function whenever you need
            it, which helps organise your code, reduce repetition, and make your
            programmes easier to manage.
