              My long-term goal is to become a skilled web developer, build

                <strong>Strengths:</strong> I’m tenacious, reflective, and
                committed to producing high-quality work. I value clear
                communication, structure, and I’m proactive about
                problem-solving.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> I sometimes struggle with focus,
                overcomplicate things, and can be hard on myself. Too much
                open-ended freedom can feel overwhelming, so I work best when I
                can follow clear steps and frameworks.
