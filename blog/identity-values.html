              In a previous design role, I always prioritised inclusivity in my
              work, regularly advocating for better representation of genders
              and ethnicities in advertising within a male-dominated industry. I
              was also mindful of the language we used.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was often asked to create promotional material for “crazy”,
              “mad”, and “insane” sales — terms that can be problematic,
              insensitive, and dismissive of mental health experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confident in my position, I often voiced these concerns to my
              manager and other decision-makers, suggesting alternative wording
              that kept the campaign's energy without using harmful language.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m glad to have helped the brand uphold its integrity while
              promoting inclusivity. Thinking about it now, I’m reminded that
              small decisions like these contribute to a culture of respect and
              empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, since I left, I’ve noticed the company has gone
              back to having “crazy” and “insane” sales. Looking back, I realise
              these issues needed to be escalated higher and addressed
              company-wide for lasting change.

              <h2>
                Describe how your culture and the people around you have
                influenced your values and identity.

                There’s a strong emphasis in Japanese culture on respecting
                others, maintaining harmony, working diligently, and
                contributing to the well-being of the group. Even before I fully
                understood these values on a cultural level, I felt them in my
                blood. They came naturally to me and shaped how I approached
                relationships and challenges from a young age.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also place great importance on empathy and authenticity. I try
                to be mindful of my emotions and how my actions affect others,
                and I’m learning to navigate challenges with grace and
                thoughtfulness. Together, these influences have made me someone
                who values sincerity, quiet strength, and meaningful
                connections. It’s important to me to live in a way that reflects
                those values.

                My key strengths are integrity, honesty, and empathy. I believe
                these will support me by helping me build genuine, respectful
                relationships with my peers and facilitators. I’m comfortable
                being honest about where I’m at, which will help me ask
                questions when I need to, and offer encouragement to others when
                they’re struggling too. Integrity keeps me accountable to my
                work and to the people around me, and empathy reminds me that
                we’re all learning together.

              <h2>
                Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
                development. How might these affect your learning journey?

                I can be overly self-critical and have a strong attention to
                detail, often striving for perfection. In the past, this has
                sometimes led to projects remaining unfinished.
              </p>
              <p>
                These habits can slow my progress or cause unnecessary stress
                during my learning and career development, as I may spend too
                much time on minor details instead of moving forward. To manage
                this, I’ve learned to take a step back (sometimes literally)
                from a project and return with fresh eyes, which helps me avoid
                getting stuck in my own head. I also aim to seek feedback early
                in the design process, which allows me to course-correct before
                investing too much time in one direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being aware of this helps me consciously balance quality with
                efficiency and focus on steady growth. Over time, I’ve worked to
                let go of perfectionism and adopt the mindset that 90% is good
                enough, knowing that progress comes from consistent effort and
                continuous improvement.

                strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
                your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and
                why.

                I’ve worked alongside colleagues and clients who weren’t as
                invested in projects as I was, which made progress challenging.
              </p>
              <p>
                To manage this, I took an active lead by delegating clearly
                defined tasks and scheduling regular check-ins to keep everyone
                aligned. While these methods helped, the project still dragged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going forward, I’d focus even more on establishing clear
                expectations early by using a schedule, detailed briefs, and
                defined processes, while maintaining open, supportive
                communication.
