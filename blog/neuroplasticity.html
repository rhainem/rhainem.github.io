        <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>
          <br />Recently, I’ve been revisiting some really useful ideas about
          neuroplasticity and growth mindset. It’s been a good reminder of how
          our brains work and how we can take small, simple steps to help
          ourselves learn better.

            <p>
              Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help people
              realise that intelligence and skills are not fixed. It shows that
              with effort and practice, you can learn new things and improve.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might use the AGES learning model — which stands for
              Attention, Generation, Emotion, and Spacing — to help strengthen
              your brain and learn better.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can increase neuroplasticity by playing language and math
              games, learning new skills, staying curious, and practising
              regularly.

                A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your
                abilities through effort, learning, and persistence.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s relevant because it helps you face challenges and setbacks,
                knowing you can get better with practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning about the AGES learning model made me realise there are
                simple, practical ways to help your brain learn better.
              </p>
              <p>
                I plan to apply a growth mindset to my learning journey by
                reminding myself, when I face a challenge, that I have the
                potential to understand it in the future if I keep at it.

              <p>
                Relearning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset has reminded
                me how to face challenges: to approach them knowing they’re
                helping me grow. I’ll try to use the AGES model to plan my study
                time by paying attention, creating my own notes or summaries,
                experiement with connecting learning to emotions or real-life
                examples, and spacing out my study sessions. I’ll also remind
                myself during tough moments that my skills can improve with
                practice.
